Don’t try to think about it too much, just try your best on these, Okay?  What I want you to do is probably just – why don’t we just stick with the second one where it says “Thursday Week Seven.”  You don’t have to do the first one right now; we’ll come back to that. Let me just read this real quick while you’re kind of working on it. It says, “Miss W’s class read for a total of 450 hours this month.  Mr. G’s class read two-thirds the number of hours read by Miss W’s class.  Miss R’s class read twice the number of hours read by Mr. G’s class.  If there were a total of 90 students in these three classrooms, what was the average number of hours read per student?” What was the average?  Remember we were doing a little bit of averaging yesterday?  So what you need to do is find the total of hours and divide that by the number of students. That will give you the average that each student read. So we have 450 hours this month that these 90 students read, right? So what is the average?  They’re asking you, what is the average amount?  Maybe they had one super student that read all 450 hours, right?  And then the 89 other students didn't read at all.  But they’re looking for the average. Go ahead.",student,The answer?,teacher,"Go ahead, what do you think?",student,I think the answer is five hours per student.,teacher,Five hours per student.  And how did you figure that out?,student,"Because I just thought about it without the zeroes at the end, I thought about 9 times 5 equals 45, so that means 90 times 5 must be 450.",teacher,"Okay, so you see, you figured it out just kind of by thinking about it.

Technically, you could call this a rectangular prism because a square is a rectangle, but we’re gonna – we’re not gonna worry about the names.  Student K, it’s not gonna help you if you just remember names of 3-D shapes. It’s really not gonna help you.  What’s gonna help you to start to understand the characteristics of them.  What – how can we describe them.  So like Student T started to say, this one looks rectangular or this one has a square. So what you’re going to do is you’re gonna be in a group either of three or four.  One person’s gonna get the bag.",student,Me.,teacher,"Please, please, please listen to the directions.
